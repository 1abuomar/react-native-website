Native Module and Native Components are our stable technologies used by the legacy architecture.

We recommend using the New Architecture, which is enabled by default from [0.76](/blog/2024/10/23/release-0.75). You shuold write new modules and components as [Turbo Native Module](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/blob/main/docs/turbo-modules.md) and [Fabric Native Components](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/blob/main/docs/fabric-native-components.md). Existing Native Modules and Native Component will continue to run on the New Architecture using our interop layer.
